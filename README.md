# Crimedata-regression

## Importing Libraries, Data and Data Cleaning:

We picked the "Crimedata" dataset from Kaggle.com after doing research on several websites where we might get a dataset for our project. The selected dataset has 147 variables. The main aim of rationale is to predict the crime rate from the given dataset. Most of the variables are continuous variables that makes it easy to perform Regression analysis with the dataset.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kkanda/communities%20and%20crime%20unnormalized%20data%20set

### We are taking the target variable as ‘ViolentCrimesPerPop’:
total number of violent crimes per 100K population (numeric - decimal) GOAL attribute (to be predicted)

## Model Selection - Cross Validation:

After the training and testing phase, we selected three machine learning model,

•	Linear Regression

•	Support Vector Regression

•	Polnomial Regression

## Conclusion:


From the analysis and understanding of Regression it can be concluded that Linear Regression has the best performance among the analyzed models
